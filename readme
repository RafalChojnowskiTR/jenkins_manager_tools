TOOLS USAGE:

0) Go to JenkinsCredentialsManager.py and provide credentials that you use to enter Jenkins for QA and PPE envs

Using the RunJenkinsJobs.py:
    1a) Uncomment lines 92 & 93 in RunJenkinsJobs.py and comment all the other lines at the end of the file.
    2a) Execute in CMD: RunJenkinsJobs.py -e <environment[qa/ppe]> -t <type[reg/smk]> -g <group[agws/core]>

    1b) Comment lines 92 & 93 in RunJenkinsJobs.py and uncomment lines that you need at the end of the file, e.g.:
            env, test_type, test_group = "qa", "reg", "file"
            run(env, test_type, test_group)
        This will run all the jobs in QA regression that contain phrase "file" in its name
    2b) Run RunJenkinsJobs.py from CMD or IDE without additional parameters

Using RunJenkinsSourceJobs.py:
    1) Edit line 24 - change env variable to either "qa" of "ppe" - depending on which env source jobs you want to trigger
    2) Run RunJenkinsSourceJobs.py from CMD or IDE without additional parameters
